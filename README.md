> Help-Chem is an app designed to perform some chemical operations like stoichiometric calculations, concentration of a solution,  Balance of matter and thermodynamics calculations.


## How to Use Help- Chem

---
### Navigation
---

* When you open the app, you will find the following home page that explains a little about Help-Chem and what it does.



    ![Home_Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuanBeltranG/ResourcesJBG/master/Help-Chem/Home_page.png)

<br/>

* After pushing the "Start" button you will be able to choose a specific area from which you want to perform an operation.

<br/>

* There you will find a submenu and choose the calculation you want to perform.

<br/>

* Finally you will be able to fill the required inputs and calculate it.

### Modules
---

For now Help-Chem isn't finished so there are only 3 areas under development.

1. Concentration of a solution / Stoichiometry. 
1. Thermodynamics.
1. Matter balance.

But over time we hope to be able to add more operations and calculations. :\)

### Data
---

Since Help-Chem is an app designed to perform some calculations related to chemistry, it is nessary to consult some data from the periodic table to perform the calculations.

Because of the above Help-Chem works using the following JSON file wich contains all the data required.
